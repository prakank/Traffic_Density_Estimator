# Traffic Density Estimator
Traffic Density Estimator: It will take as input a footage of the road and will give a detailed analysis of the static and dynamic data. Along with this, code has been optimized using multi-threading. <br/>

Appropriate plots are plotted using python scripts for a better analysis. <br/>

Copy the video into the Task3 folder to get the required results. <br/>

As we progress from Task1 to Task3, the Density Estimator acheives its full implemenation. <br/>

## Dependencies
Make sure that `boost` and `opencv` libraries are installed in the system

## Compilation
cd to the task you want to try and Run `make` to generate the executable file. (### Make sure traffic footage is copied into that folder)

## Execution
cd to the task number and Use `make run` to run the program

## Tasks
Each task has different way of taking input. Please refer the README.md file in each task for correct input.

## Analysis
Detailed analysis is performed in Task3 and can be found in the analysis folder. A report is also attached with the analysis folder which contains the conclusion of our analysis.
